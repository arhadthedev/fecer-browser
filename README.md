## Versions

Fecer Browser follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Definitions:

- *API of a library*:
  - declarations in files inside `include/` directory
  - format of input/output data streams

- *API of an application*:
  - position and composition of GUI elements for a user with a monitor, a user
    with a reader, and an automation script
  - format of both profile and user files

This versioning policy is respected for builds generated on official clones
of the Fecer Browser repository:

- <https://github.com/arhadthedev/fecer-browser>


### Branching

The repository uses a GitLab flow with release branches. A `nextver` branch is
a master, where actual development of features and bugfixes for the next version
is performed. From this branch, release branches `{x}.{y}` are spawned. They are
used to store bugfixes backported from `nextver` to every minor version ever
published. The intent is to make life of distribution package maintainers
easier. Inside a release branch, tags with proper `x.y.z` version numbers are
created.

Builds based on non-tagged commits are considered development, so their version
is set to a pre-release _x_._y_._z_-dev+git._short_commit_id_.
